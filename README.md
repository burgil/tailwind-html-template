# tailwind-html-template
 A way to use the HTML generated by v0.dev, and make sure it looks exactly like it does in v0.dev (Using Tailwind CSS)

# How to use?

Open the terminal and make sure you are on the project root folder.

Then you need to run:

```
npm install
```
and
```
npm install -D tailwindcss
```

and then run

```
npm start
```

This will start the server that automatically creates the required output css in real time

Now to use it simply run Live Viewer on Visual Code (Go Live) from the root folder and navigate to the `uis/` folder

# Production

For production use you can try to use the `npm build` command, the server wont be needing to run in production it's a one time thing to generate the output, you wont need the input file, you wont need the placeholders, you just need the html, font and output.css file

# How this project was created?

```
npx tailwindcss init
```
(Don't run this command it was already ran)
